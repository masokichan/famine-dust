#Eras
[[Theseus]]'s discoveries eventually brought them to the discovery of the [[Garden]] , as well as the creation of [[Gateway|gateways]]; They expanded beyond what the [[Keilar]] gave, despite the latter's best efforts to stop them. They looming worlds into their grasp, using the gateways as forms of travel between them. Ascended.

Now satisfied, [[Theseus]] — after eradicating [[Keilar]] from the chain of *their* existence — had completed the Coup of Being and obtained plenary control over the natural order, beginning the life of the [[The New World]].



An era reigned stoic, encumbered, crippled, and ultimately completed by the same race that created it. 

Life (if it could even be called that anymore) under the command of [[Theseus]] was nothing more than an excuse to have someone to feed the corpses they were selling. Food became a memory as muscle, skin and organ from those now cadavers was all there seemed to were.
