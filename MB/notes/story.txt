--- Story Topics & themes, DEVELOP THIS INTO AN ACTUAL SCRIPT PLEASE!
Genetic Experiment who was born an adult, having no childhood, longing for one as she 
sees the post apocalyptic world's children laughing together playing games on the nuclear winter.

The Creation, called "Fountain" will struggle with finding who she is and what her purpose is as she meets different ideologies on what it means to be "you". 

"Grocery Store"(Mental Hospital metaphor) NPC encounter psychology (dont actually put these labels in the game ) :
psychotic, schizophrenic, suicidal, stubborn, egotistical, anxious, traumatized, (guards) Apathetic

Staring at the mirror and dissociating is how you save, while death will leave the corpse of the player
, laying dead, bleeding out as any and all audio is cut off, 
letting you sit with the very real effect that you just died, no coming back.

story game, yes it will contain lesbians.


-- Visual aesthetic --
CHAPTER 1:
    grim and grounded. war torn and it shows.
    the skyline's almost dead gray, a bit brown can be seen
    fog riddles the scene
    an incredibly noticeable lack of people except some instances
    the only trash bins found around all have an overflowing amount of dead bodies in them, only the 
    bottom bunch is even in a bag.
    a 15 people cementary


The game is very ,very gory in its visuals to represent the "body horror" aspect of it



-- Gameplay Aspects --

YOU CAN KILL ANY AND ALL NPCS!!!

MULTIPLE ENDINGS tied to gameplay(i.e. killing everything) and dialogue choices.
(One extremely nihilistic and depressing philosophy on the themes of the game IF you kill all
friendly, neutral and hostile NPC's, both with and without name.)

Any and all dialogue EXCEPT for Fountain's (until the True Ending) will be voiced.

different animation for each death type
